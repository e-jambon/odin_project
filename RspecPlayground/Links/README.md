# Links 

Just some tests with Links.
Objective would be to be able to manage links, validate those that actually point to something, actualize those that are redirected permanently etc.

Simple and ugly so far. Clearly needs some refactoring.
But has some tests in it, and there are tons more to come, it's just a beginning.
