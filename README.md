#ODIN PROJECT

These are files I have been working on while going trhough the [Odin-Project](http://ici.e-jambon.com)

If you're interested in being able to do some basic web development, odin-project is a great place where to start...
It will guide you as through your learnings in an organized curriculum.


I'm just putting things in this github, where I'll be able to find my stuff when I need it again.

There is not much to be found in here, but the start of my "Link" library I started as an example.
